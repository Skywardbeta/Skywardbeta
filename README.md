Hi, this is Tony from Keio University. This is my research account dedicated for my research on space networks and wireless communications. Most of my contributions are dedicated to Working Groups, which you can find in my Organizations. Also most open source projects I work with are hosted on Gitlab or Sourceforge. Check https://sourceforge.net/projects/ione/ for works on Delay-and-Disruption Networking. Thanks!
