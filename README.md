Hi, this is Tony from Keio University. This is my research account dedicated for my research on space networks/wireless communications and machine learning. Most of my contributions are dedicated to Working Groups, which you can find in my Organizations. Also some open source projects I worked on are on Gitlab and Sourceforge. Check https://sourceforge.net/projects/ione/ for works on ION-DTN.
